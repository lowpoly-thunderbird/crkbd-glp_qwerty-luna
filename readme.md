# Personal keymap for the CRKBD
My own keymap with some custom OLED features, Colemak base layer and gaming layers. The F13 key on multiple layers can be bound to something, I use it as toggle mute microphone on Discord.
## Layers
- Base - QWERTY Default layer
- Lower - Has numbers and arrows
- Raise - Has symbols
- BaseAlt - Alternate QWERTY layer with some tweaks for productivity
- Numpad - Numpad Layer
- Adjust - Has F-keys and settings, allows to set the BaseAlt as base layer.
